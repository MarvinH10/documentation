Cross-selling and upselling
===========================

Cross-selling and upselling are sales techniques designed to encourage customers to purchase
additional or higher-priced products and services from your :doc:`catalog`.

Cross-selling
=============

Cross-selling can be achieved by suggesting :ref:`optional products <cross_upselling/optional>` when
items are added to the cart or by recommending :ref:`accessory products <cross_upselling/accessory>`
on the checkout page.
